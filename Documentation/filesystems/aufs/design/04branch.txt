Branch Manipulation

Since aufs supports dynamic branch manipulation, ie. add/remove a branch
and changing its permission/attribute, there are a lot of works to do.


Add a Branch
----------------------------------------------------------------------
o Confirm the adding dir exists outside of aufs, including loopback
  mount, and its various attributes.
o Initialize the xino file and whiteout bases if necessary.
  See struct.txt.

o Check the owner/group/mode of the directory
  When the owner/group/mode of the adding directory differs from the
  existing branch, aufs issues a warning because it may impose a
  security risk.
  For example, when a upper writable branch has a world writable empty
  top directory, a malicious user can create any files on the writable
  branch directly, like copy-up and modify manually. If something like
  /etc/{passwd,shadow} exists on the lower readonly branch but the upper
  writable branch, and the writable branch is world-writable, then a
  malicious guy may create /etc/passwd on the writable branch directly
  and the infected file will be valid in aufs.
  I am afraid it can be a security issue, but aufs can do nothing except
  producing a warning.
